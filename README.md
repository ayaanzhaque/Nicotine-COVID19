# A Computational Analysis of the Effect of Nicotine Withdrawal on Cardiac Arrhythmia and its Relationship with COVID-19 Mortality Rates

# Abstract
Certain chronic conditions are becoming increasingly ignored due to the magnitude of COVID-19. However, continued research on these conditions, such as nicotine addiction and heart disease, and how they relate to COVID-19 will help researchers assess case severity more adequately. It has been commonly asserted that smoking cessation will reduce COVID-19 mortality rates for smokers due to how it damages the lungs. However, smoking cessation results in nicotine withdrawal which is proven to cause side effects, which could conversely increase COVID-19 mortality rates. This study aims to determine how nicotine withdrawal increases the probability of developing cardiac arrhythmia and how that relationship increases COVID-19 mortality rates. To conduct our study, we compiled datasets from various health organizations, such as the CDC, to find correlations between the three conditions. We first investigated which complications result from nicotine withdrawal and how they could develop into cardiac arrhythmia. Following initial inquiries, we then calculated how cardiac arrhythmia increases COVID-19 mortality rates. To validate our conclusions, we compared smoking cessation rates and COVID-19 mortality rates in different states to isolate correlation. We determined that nicotine withdrawal has a 32.7% probability of causing cardiac arrhythmia and that cardiac arrhythmia increases the chance of death from COVID-19 by 14.7%. Ultimately, we found that nicotine withdrawal increases the COVID-19 mortality rate by 4.8% compared to standard patients, a significant and concerning finding.
